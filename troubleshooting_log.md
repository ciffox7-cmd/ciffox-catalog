# Image Loading Troubleshooting Log

## Problem
Product images are not visible on the frontend - only placeholders are showing.

## Attempts Made

### Attempt 1: Static File Serving Fix
- **Issue**: 404 error for `placeholder.jpg`
- **Solution**: Fixed static file mounting in `main.py` to dynamically find static directory
- **Result**: Placeholder images now load, but actual product images still don't

### Attempt 2: Local Image Serving via API
- **Issue**: Database contained only filenames, not full URLs
- **Solution**: Created `/api/product-image/{filename}` endpoint to serve local images
- **Result**: Local images (IMG-*.jpg) load correctly, but Google Drive images don't

### Attempt 3: Google Drive URL Upload
- **Issue**: Images were stored locally but needed to be on Google Drive
- **Solution**: Created script to upload local images to Google Drive and update database
- **Result**: Database updated with Google Drive URLs, but images still not visible

### Attempt 4: Google Drive URL Format Fix (Multiple iterations)
- **Issue**: Google Drive URLs had wrong format causing CORS issues
- **Tried**: 
  - Converting from `uc?export=view` to `usercontent.google.com` format
  - Converting from `download?id=` to `uc?id=` format
- **Result**: URLs are correct format but images still not loading

### Attempt 5: Frontend JavaScript Updates
- **Issue**: Frontend might not be detecting Google Drive URLs correctly
- **Solution**: Updated JavaScript to detect both `drive.google.com` and `usercontent.google.com` URLs
- **Result**: JavaScript correctly detects URLs but images still fail to load

### Attempt 6: Cache Busting (Multiple iterations)
- **Issue**: Browser might be caching old JavaScript
- **Solution**: Implemented aggressive cache busting (v19, v20, v21)
- **Result**: Cache cleared but images still not loading

## Current Status
- ✅ Server running on port 8000
- ✅ API returning correct Google Drive URLs (`https://drive.usercontent.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID`)
- ✅ Frontend JavaScript correctly detecting Google Drive URLs
- ✅ Local images (IMG-*.jpg) loading correctly via `/api/product-image/` endpoint
- ❌ Google Drive images not loading despite correct URLs

## Server Logs Analysis
From the terminal logs, I can see:
- Google Drive URLs are being requested as: `/api/product-image/https%3A//drive.google.com/uc?id=...`
- This means the frontend is still routing Google Drive URLs through the local API endpoint
- The frontend should be using Google Drive URLs directly, not through `/api/product-image/`

## Root Cause Identified
The frontend JavaScript is NOT working correctly. Despite all the cache busting, it's still routing Google Drive URLs through the `/api/product-image/` endpoint instead of using them directly.

## Additional Findings
- Google Drive URLs return 200 OK but have `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` header
- This CSP header blocks the images from being displayed in img tags
- The frontend JavaScript is correctly detecting Google Drive URLs but they can't be displayed due to CSP

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Check the actual HTML being served to verify JavaScript is updated
2. ✅ Test Google Drive URLs directly in browser to confirm they work
3. ✅ Fix the frontend JavaScript logic that determines when to use Google Drive URLs vs local API
4. ✅ Convert Google Drive URLs to a format that works with CSP restrictions
5. ✅ Use Google Drive's thumbnail API to bypass CSP restrictions

## Final Solution
- **Root Cause**: Google Drive URLs had CSP restrictions preventing display in img tags
- **Solution**: Converted URLs to Google Drive thumbnail format (`https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=FILE_ID&sz=w400-h400`)
- **Frontend Fix**: Updated JavaScript detection to properly identify Google Drive URLs including thumbnail format
- **Result**: Images should now load correctly without CSP restrictions

## Final Verification
- ✅ API returns correct Google Drive thumbnail URLs for first 145 products
- ✅ Google Drive thumbnail URLs have proper CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`)
- ✅ Frontend JavaScript updated to detect thumbnail URLs correctly
- ✅ Cache busting implemented to force browser reload (v25)
- ✅ Google Drive thumbnail URLs are accessible and return 200 OK
- ✅ CORS headers are present for cross-origin requests

## Issue #10: `lh3.googleusercontent.com` URLs failing to load
- **Issue**: Google Drive URLs in format `https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/FILE_ID=w400-h400` are failing with "Image failed to load" errors
- **Root Cause**: These URLs require authentication or proper Google Drive permissions, and direct embedding doesn't work
- **Solution**: Use the existing `/api/proxy-image` endpoint in backend to proxy Google Drive images and bypass authentication/CORS issues
- **Frontend Change**: Update frontend to use `/api/proxy-image?url=ENCODED_URL` for Google Drive images instead of direct URLs

## Issue #11: Complete Image Upload Solution
- **Issue**: User requested to upload ALL 275 product images to Google Drive to ensure proper image-to-data matching
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive upload script that:
  - Maps all 275 products to their corresponding image files (IMG-20251003-WA0003.jpg to IMG-20251003-WA0277.jpg)
  - Uploads all images to Google Drive with proper permissions
  - Updates database with `lh3.googleusercontent.com` URLs for all products
  - Uses proxy endpoint to serve images without CORS issues
- **Result**: All 275 images successfully uploaded and database updated
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All images now served from Google Drive via proxy endpoint

## Issue #12: Admin Page Images Not Loading & Slow Image Loading
- **Issue**: Images not showing on admin page and slow loading on index page
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Admin page was using direct Google Drive URLs instead of proxy endpoint
  - Sequential image loading was causing slow performance
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `getImageUrl()` function to admin page for proper Google Drive URL handling
  - Implemented concurrent image loading with queue management (6-8 concurrent loads)
  - Increased `rootMargin` to 100px for earlier loading
  - Updated both index and admin pages with optimized loading
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Both pages now load images faster and correctly
